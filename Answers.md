1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I spent more time than I would have liked. Halfway through I realized I had done some overthinking and started working another path.

2. Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

I chose to do the project in React, I had tried VUE.js before, and didn't really like the framework. So I figured I would challenge myself a little aswell and learn React as I go. As for the API I used ASP.Net core. Since it is the one I've been using before and the one that I know.

3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

My initial thought was to upload the documents to a server and then read them from there. If I would have had more time that is what I would have liked to add to my solution.

4. What did you think of this recruitment test?

I thought the test was challenging, but a lot of fun. String-comparing is something I haven't done much of before, so it was a useful lesson aswell.
